# Documentation & Memory

> **Applies when:** always — this defines where project knowledge lives and how it survives context compaction.
> **Delete this file (and its `@` import in CLAUDE.md) if:** never. If the project keeps its knowledge base elsewhere, retarget the paths rather than dropping the module.

## Two tiers of memory

- **`docs/claude/` — team-shared, committed to git.** Facts about the project that any contributor or agent needs: what is being built now, what shipped, why the architecture is the way it is, and the patterns and gotchas that cost someone a day to learn. If a teammate would benefit, it goes here.
- **`~/.claude/` — personal, never committed.** Individual preferences, machine-local setup, per-user workflow habits. Keep it out of `docs/claude/`, because personal preference presented as project doctrine misleads everyone else on the team.

The distinction is not about secrecy, it is about durability: committed docs are versioned alongside the code they describe, so they can be reviewed, corrected, and blamed.

## Read order (start here, in this order)

1. **`docs/claude/in-progress.md`** — the ordered queue of what is next, with pointers to plan docs. Always read this first; it tells you what the current work actually is, which is the one thing a fresh context window cannot infer from the code.
2. **`docs/claude/architecture.md`** — the decisions and their reasoning, so you extend the design instead of re-litigating it.
3. **`docs/claude/key-patterns.md`** — conventions, gotchas, and testing practice, so your code matches what is already there.
4. **`docs/claude/infrastructure.md`** — deploy pipeline, hosting, data stores, secrets, background jobs. Read before touching anything that runs outside the dev machine.
5. **`docs/claude/completed-features.md`** — what already exists, so you do not rebuild it.
6. **The relevant area folder** (e.g. `docs/claude/<area>/…`) — active plans and research for the feature you are working on.

Read the specific files that bear on the task, not all of them every time. But never start non-trivial work without at least `in-progress.md` and the area folder for the thing you are changing.

## The always-current plan & worklog

Four artifacts, four altitudes. Each owns ONE fact-granularity; nothing restates another, so nothing
drifts. This is the anti-redundancy contract — keep to it and the logs cannot contradict each other.

| Altitude | File | Owns | Granularity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic | `docs/claude/roadmap.md` | Initiatives, their band (Now/Next/Later), links down | one initiative |
| Tactical | `docs/claude/in-progress.md` | The active queue, blocked, parked, per-row Next step | one task/feature |
| Continuous | `docs/claude/worklog.md` **or** the repo's `CHANGELOG`/`HISTORY` `[Unreleased]` | What actually landed | one change |
| Durable | `docs/claude/completed-features.md` | What now exists + its archived plan path | one shipped feature |

A fifth surface, `CHANGELOG.md`/`HISTORY.md` release notes, is **user-facing and derived** — curated
from the worklog at release time, not maintained per-change in parallel. If the repo uses its
`[Unreleased]` section AS the running worklog, there is no separate `worklog.md` (one running log, never two).

### The same-change update contract (every agent, every provider)

In the SAME commit that lands work — Claude, Codex, Cursor, or any other tool:

1. **Append one worklog line** (to `worklog.md`, or the `[Unreleased]` section) — what changed, where.
2. **Update the `in-progress.md` row**: its status and its Next-step handoff — or remove the row on ship.
3. **On ship**, additionally: add the `completed-features.md` entry, MOVE the `roadmap.md` initiative
   (to Shipped if this was its last plan), and archive the plan folder.
4. **On a new or reprioritised initiative**: add or move its `roadmap.md` row.

This contract is plain-markdown, enforced by review and `/audit-claude-setup` — never a Claude-only
permission gate, so it binds a non-Claude agent exactly as much as a Claude one. It is mirrored into
`AGENTS.md` so every tool reads it. **Shipped-but-unlogged counts as not done** (see below).

## When to write

- **When a plan is made** — persist it to a file under the area folder, from `docs/claude/_templates/plan.md`, and link it from `in-progress.md`. Plans that live only in chat are erased by compaction.
- **During the build, at the moment of discovery** — when reality contradicts the plan, record it inline with a `> **Build note:**` line. Written later, it is written wrong; written never, the next person rediscovers it the expensive way.
- **When you pause or hand off** — before you stop, write the *exact next action* where the next session looks first: the `Notes` cell of the active row in `in-progress.md`, or the `Next step` line of the plan doc for a multi-session feature. Not a topic ("continue the auth work") — the file to open, the function to change, the command to run, the blocker. A cold session resumes from this and nothing else, so it is the one note always worth writing: the person who needs it is not you, and cannot reconstruct where you stopped from the code alone.
- **When a decision is made that a future reader would otherwise question** — add an ADR entry to `architecture.md`. The trigger is "someone will wonder why we did this," not "this was hard."
- **Always ADR-worthy: anything that moves a layer boundary or introduces a port.** A new port and the adapter behind it, a rule relocated between layers, a Detail swapped out (database, framework, vendor), or a deliberate decision to let one layer know about another. These are precisely what `architecture.md` exists for: the reasoning is invisible in the diff six months later, so without the entry the next person re-litigates a decision that was already made carefully. See `clean-architecture.md`.
- **When you get burned by a non-obvious behavior** — add it to `key-patterns.md` as a gotcha, with the symptom, not just the fix. The next person will arrive with the symptom.
- **When infrastructure changes** — update `infrastructure.md` in the same PR as the change. Infra docs that lag the infra are worse than none, because they are trusted.

Update the doc in the same PR as the code it describes. A "docs pass later" never happens. **Shipped-but-unlogged counts as not done:** if it is live and the log does not show it, the task is unfinished — finish it by writing the record. The first time the log lags reality, every reader stops trusting it and re-reads the code instead, which is the exact cost this whole file exists to avoid.

## When to archive

After a feature is tested and signed off:

1. Move its entire folder — plan, research, references, everything — into that area's `completed/` subfolder.
2. **Rename the files to describe what shipped**, not generic `plan.md`. A folder of six files named `plan.md` is unsearchable.
3. Add an entry to `completed-features.md`: what shipped, when, and the archived path.
4. Remove the item from `in-progress.md`.
5. Update any closed issue or milestone descriptions that pointed at the old paths.

Archive, do not delete. The reasoning behind a shipped feature is the context for the next change to it.

## Hygiene

- One fact, one home. If something belongs in `architecture.md`, do not also paste it into a plan file — copies drift, and a reader cannot tell which copy is current.
- **`completed-features.md` is the feature narrative, not a changelog.** It records what a user or
  caller can now do, plus the archived plan path. If the repo keeps a `CHANGELOG.md`/`HISTORY.md`,
  that stays the release/commit line; `completed-features.md` may reference a release but never
  restates the commit log. One fact, one home — across both files, and across the four altitudes above.
- Correct stale docs on sight. Finding an out-of-date statement and leaving it there makes you the reason the next person trusts it.
- Keep entries short and dated. These files are read under context pressure; a wall of prose gets skimmed and misread.
